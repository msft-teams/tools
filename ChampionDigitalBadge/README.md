<img src="https://github.com/msft-teams/tools/blob/ChampionDigitalBadge/ChampionDigitalBadge/readmeimages/digitalbadge.png" alt="Digital Badge Screen" style="width: 100%;">

## Introduction / Overview

The Digital Badge App is intended to allow Teams Champions to apply a "Champion" badge overlay quickly and easily to their existing profile image and have it populated across their Office 365 tenant.

## How It Works

1. The current version of the Digital Badge operates as a Teams app installed locally in your tenant by your tenant administrator. This is a cloud only Office 365 solution and is not supported on premises.  Once installed it can be accessed via "+Add a tab" option at the top of the channel. ***Channel > Add a tab > Digital Badge***

2. Users will need to consent and click "Accept" to allow the application to modify their profile image across all Office 365 applications.

3. The app installation process will create a SharePoint list (***Champions List***) to store all users who are eligible for a digital badge. A local administrator is responsible for maintaining this SharePoint list. All users added to this SharePoint list will have permission to apply the Digital Badge.

4. After the user clicks "Accept", the app will display a composite image that will look like:

5. A successful acceptance will look like:

6. If a user is not included in the SharePoint list they are notified that they are not qualified for Champion Badge program at this time.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the administrator who will install the app has access to following:

*  Global or SharePoint Administrator role in the target tenant 
*  Digital Badge project in GitHub

### Install Digital Badge SPFx Package

1. Download Code / clone from GitHub.

2. To use the default configuration:
   a. Navigate to the solution folder where you cloned and locate the digital-badge.sppkg package in ***"sharepoint/solution"***.

### Customize configuration

If desired the administrator can configure a customized site, list, and/or column using following steps:

1. Update the ***"src/webparts/digitalBadge/config/siteconfig.json"*** configuration file.  Changing the values in the JSON file will customize the SharePoint list location and/or schema when it is created during deployment.

· sitename (SharePoint site name)

· list (SharePoint list for maintaining Champions)

```

2. Create the SharePoint App Package.  This package will be used to deploy the application in SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. Run the below commands :
